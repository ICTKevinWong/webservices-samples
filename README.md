This project is intended to host sample code that illustrates the use of the NetApp SANtricity Web Services API. The
Web Services API provides a RESTful API for management of NetApp E-Series storage-systems.

While the REST API is easy to use, many users of our existing management functionality are unfamilar with similar API's.
This repository is intended to make developing against the API easier for our users by providing code samples that
illustrate proper usage.

While NetApp developers will be the initial contributors to this repository, contributions from other users are welcomed
and encouraged.
